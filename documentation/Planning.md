# Microsoft Malware Prediction - Planning

### Working effort:
 1. Literature review (read some kernels(at least 5) and relevant content related to malware prediction);
 2. Data exploration (replicate EDA done by others and try to find some new insights);
 3. Algorithm development (algorithms that seems to be promissing);
 4. Result analysis (review model performances, competition metric is AUC (area under the ROC curve));
 5. Review (review each model process including it's data generation).
 
### Working cycle:
1. Read competition info, existing info and relevant content to feel confortable with the problem. Create hyphotesis based in that info;
2. Initial data exploration, again to feel confortable with the problem and the data;
3. Build the first implementation (simple);
4. Loop throught [Analyze -> Approach(model) -> Implement -> Measure].

### 1. Literature review (read some kernels(at least 5) and relevant content related to malware prediction) (post links bellow).
